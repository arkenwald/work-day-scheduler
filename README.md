# work-day-scheduler

Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

A daily planner was created with HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, and Dayjs libraries to add important events.

A great way to manage time effectively with colour coded time blocks.


Installation

To install the project, I've initiated my local working folder into a GitHub Repository, then pushed the local files to the Repository after adding and commiting the updated codes.

To access the project, please enter the Live Page URL found below.


Usage

The user will be able to see the current date and time once the planner is opened.

There are time slots in which the user may input their important event that they wish to have saved.

The time slots are color coded in relative to the current time of the user:

Grey: Past

Red: Current Hour

Green: Future

Once the user inputs their event, they may click on the save button within that timeblock to have it saved in local storage.
